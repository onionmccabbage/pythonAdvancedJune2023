Advanced Python Review Exercise 1 until 2:30
=================================
In a new module write a class called 'NumberFun' with one property, a positive integer
Write decorated methods to get and set the property 
Invalid entries should default to 1
Use 'name-mangling' for the actual property

Declare a __str__ method which returns:
- the number
- the square of the number
- the square root ( sqrt = n**0.5 # returns square root of n )

Exercise the code to show it works as expected ( if __name__ =='__main__' )

At the end, some of you may like to show what you built

Optional
--------
Write a method in your class which finds out if the integer is odd or even
Write another method which finds out if the number is itself a square number
Use these functions in your __str__ method

Extend your class into a new class that also takes a boolean values
If the boolean is set to True, your __str__ method should also show todays date

Super Optional
--------------
Build a separate class that imports your class then introspects the intrinsicts (e.g. dict etc)
prints a nice summar of the class and some of its intrinsicts
