Advanced Python Review 2 (until 3:00)
========================
This is an opportunity to work with databases, or if you prefer 
do the whole exercise with file read/write instead of databases

In a new package, write a module to implement a database (or file) for 'posts'
You can use the following API to get a very large number of 'posts':
  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

Details:
Write a module which will add a new table to your existing database 
(you only need to run this once)
Decide on a name for your table, such as 'posts'
This new table needs columns for 'id' 'userId' 'title' and 'body'
(id should be the primary key)
Decide on suitable SQL data types for these fields (e.g. VARCHAR(256) for 'body')

Write a module which will retrieve the JSON data for all the 'posts'
Then iterate over the retrieved data to populate your new table

In another module, ask the user which userId they are interested in 
Then retrieve and display all the 'posts' for that userId (use a 'WHERE' clause in the SQL)
(You will need to validate that the userId is a positive integer within bounds)
CAREFUL - userId is a number, so don't use quotes in the SQL statement

Architecture:
Use classes, functions and/or modules as you see fit
Once the initial database has been created and populated, write code to encapslate neat ways to:
- create a new (valid) 'post' item
- update existing 'post' items, e.g. changing the value of 'title'

Optional:
Populate a new database table with the 'todos' from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
Find a way to show only 'completed' todo items for a given userId
Show all todos AND posts for a given userId
Find all the incomplete todos and set them to completed
