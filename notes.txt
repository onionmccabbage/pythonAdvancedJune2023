12:30 lunch
3:00 tea
4:30 end

- you will need: a copy of Python 3.x
- a code editor: VS Code, PyCharm etc...
- internet, able to install python libraries (e.g. requests library)

Python code lives in classes (or in functions), in modules, which live in packages (folders)

Monday
> intro and welcome
  - what do you currently know
  - what do you want to know
> classes 
> abstract and concrete classes
> validate types
> inheritance
> name mangled members
- if __name__== '__main__': revisited
> using decorators
> after lunch review
> instrinsics
- functional programming: map, filter and reduce
- functional programming: parameters
- comprehensions, generators and yield
- Loading local and remote data (requests)

Tuesday
- processing text/json
  - json.loads() takes JSON and returns Python structure
  - json.dumps() takes Python structure and returns JSON
- persisting files: read/write/append/exclusive/overwrite
- databases
  see https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseProgramming
- other db connections (inc no-sql)
- Create, Read and Update (and DELETE) - CRUD operations
- populate db with sample data
- read and nicely format values from the db
- after lunch review exercise 
  ask questions, help each other, share code (screen-share)
- we will be using the 'requests' library
  (you may come across the urllib.requests which is the old-skool way of doing things)

Wednesday
- context manager - switch context e.g. for handling data input and output
- networking server/client (microservices)
- overview of Flask
- Testing: 
  - doctest revisited
  see https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html
  - unittest
- after lunch lab exercise
- pytest see https://docs.pytest.org/

Thursday
- profiling: timings etc. (cprofile)
- multithreading
- the global Interpreter Lock (GIL) will affect threading performance
- using thread locks
- Python has -O to optimize code (especially useful for threading)
- after lunch lab exercise
- logging - context mgr, often we log by time-stamp
- named tuple
- after lunch review
- zip, deque, iter etc
- end of course feedback
