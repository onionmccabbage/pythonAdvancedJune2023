Advanced Python Review 4: until 3:00
========================= 
There is an API end-point here: https://swapi.dev/api  	   
(it is a Python API written in Django)
It includes some documentation here: https://swapi.dev/documentation

Architect an application to use the swapi API

It is used by passing parameters for 'category' and 'id' e.g.
  https://swapi.dev/api/people/1
  https://swapi.dev/api/species/3
Category can be any one of 'people', 'planets', 'species'. 'starships' or 'vehicles' 
(maybe use a named tuple for these)
The id can be in the range 1-12 (though some id values currently fail)
NB Vehicles is problematic, but id=7 works. Handle problems with exception handlers etc.

Either ask the user for a category and an id, or read values in from a data file or sys.argv
In all cases, check they are valid then make a get request and show the returned json
Append a few data properties to a text file (or byte file)
(you could also show them on the screen)
  E.g. every category includes a 'name' property
  The 'people' category includes 'hair_color' and 'height'
  The 'planets' category includes 'orbital_period' and 'population'
  The 'species' category includes 'designation' and 'homeworld'
  The 'starships' category includes 'model' and 'manufacturer' 
  The 'vehicles' caltegory includes 'manufacturer' and 'model'

Optional
--------
Try to make the request happen in it's own thread
Architect your application so you have classes for 
   'People', 'Planets', 'Species'. 'Starships' and 'Vehicles'
These classes could all descend from a common base class called 'Swapi'
Write your 'swapi_service' (to access the API) in a separate module
Populate an instance of the relevant class depending on the returned data
(You could also encapsulate errors in a class too)

Super Optional
--------------
Use a separate thread to make a request for all the categories, 
then offer these as options for the user
As soon as their 'category/id' request returns, make further (threaded) 
requests for each film in the returned data set

Add 'Swapi' functionality to your microservice or Flask app from before

Consider what unit tests you could write
